# Vera Rubin â€“ Engine V2

This repository contains the latest engine's boilerplate for Vera Rubin's OrbitViewer. This repo will be used to rewrite the foundations of the engine with updated libraries while tackling technical enhancements such as:

- Orbit Calculations improvements
- Data Query Mechanisms Optimizations
- Libraries & Code-base updates
- VFX & WebGL foundations

## Main

The static site template is a web Front-End project using 11ty, ESBuild, SASS & Nunjucks. No back-end dependency here. It uses our [fils](https://github.com/fil-studio/fils/tree/main) framework.

Download/Clone + Start Here with `yarn` or `npm i` and then `yarn dev` or `npm run dev` to launch static server.

Uses [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) static generator and [ThreeJS](https://threejs.org/) for WebGL based sketches.

Happy Coding!
